Welcome to my website! I am a composer of music that seeks to communicate deeply about consciousness and the weird and wonderful nature of our existence. 

As a composer, I enjoy creating evocative sounds that inspire the imagination. My compositions of the last 10 years have focused on audiovisual works and works for instrument and electronics. My tools of choice are numerous, but I probably work most frequently in SuperCollider, Max (jitter), and non-linear editors for audio and video.

As a professor of music technology at Georgia Southern University, I have had the pleasure of sharing my passion for music and technology with students for almost two decades. I am dedicated to helping my students develop their own creative voices and encouraging them to consider deeply the intersection of technology and music.

If you are someone who is interested in to weird and wonderful music, I invite you to explore my website. Not only can you find my music here, but you can also find pedagogical materials regarding music technology. Additionally, I catalog my musical experiements and thoughts here.

Thank you for visiting my website!
