I am a composer of music that seeks to communicate my fascination about consciousness and the nature of ourselves. 

I enjoy creating evocative sounds that inspire the imagination. My compositions of the last 10 years have focused on audiovisual works and works for instrument and electronics. My tools of choice are numerous, but I probably work most frequently in SuperCollider, Max (jitter), and non-linear editors for audio and video.

I am professor of music technology at Georgia Southern University and head of the music technology program. I have had the pleasure of sharing my passion for music and technology with students for almost two decades. I am dedicated to helping my students develop their own creative voices and encouraging them to consider deeply the intersection of technology and music.

My music is posted here, along with some thoughts that contextualize each work. I also post pedagogical materials regarding music technology, software projects, and musical experiments.

Please contact me if you would like to perform or program my music, or if you simply would like to know more about it.
