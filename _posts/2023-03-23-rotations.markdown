Pablo Tobar was a graduate student of mine during the 2021-22 school year. He is a fantastic performer and we were both motivated to collaborate to create a work for him to perform. During the spring of 2022, there were a few works of mine that were being newly performed and polished / finished. Those included "Shift-13" and "The Changing Light". Putting the clarinet piece into the mix meant I had to work fairly quickly.

Rotations is a piece for clarinet and 8-channel live electronics. In addition to the simple idea of moving the clarinet around the circle of speakers at various rhythmic intervals, there is also a rather complicated system for associating harmonic space with the physical space. The clarinet rotates through these spaces simultaneously. The harmonic space is realized by appropriately pitch-shifting the clarinet.

Notating the multiphonics was (as always) an enlightening experience, and I glad to have Pablo there to share his intimate knowledge of the clarinet with me.
