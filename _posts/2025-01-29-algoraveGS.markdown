I organized an algorave at Georgia Southern in the Fall of 2024. The algorave consisted of a series of works that sprang forth from the Live Coding course I taught in that semester. 

Using some material from a set I performed in Atlanta and New York City, I developed my own set for the event.  Like Ambient X 808, parts of the work are inspired by my lifelong love of hip hop. Unlike, Ambient X 808, we skip straight to the dance music. The set was recorded and is presented here at the 01:13:06 mark.
