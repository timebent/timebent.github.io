I was looking at Lance Putnam's "S Phase" work from the 2000s. https://w2.mat.ucsb.edu/l.putnam/s_phase/index.html In this work, Putnam is directly driving the visual material from the sonic material using 3D lissajous techniques. In short, this is where the amplitudes of audio signals are used to inform the positions of (x,y,z) vertices in a virtual space. 

In the documentation of "S Phase", Putnam is kind enough to supply a diagram of how it all works. In this experiment, I reconstruct the process, minus a few elements that treat the sound (detoning, chorusing).

I go a bit further with the visual side of things creating a feedback system.

Here are some quickly edited results of what this supplies. 

1) The typical harmonic visualization that the lissjous provides:

2) A more chaotic example. I like the transitional moment here. Also, the visibility of the images was more clear in the beginning portion. Sometimes these visualizations tend to be subtle and dimly lit. This is made even worse with youtube compression.

3) In this example, I like when the images produce these unpredictable hieroglyphic type shapes in response to the sound:

4) Finally, a (slightly) unabridged version if for those that are especially interested:
