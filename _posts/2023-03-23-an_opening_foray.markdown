I am attempting to restart the timebent website. The goal will be to host my compositional work, some pedagogical materials, and to have a space to put organize some of my thoughts. The old website went down because I just couldn't handle constantly dealing with a hacked WordPress situation. I'm hoping that github pages will make the process less burdensome.
