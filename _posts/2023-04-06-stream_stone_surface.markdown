Stream Stone Surface was written in 2013. It is the first of a series of works exploring audiovisual composition. During this time I was beginning to formalize ideas about audiovisual composition in order to teach them in the graduate program. I was examining the work of Jordan Belson, who said the following:

".. movement is inherent in graphics, even in still graphics. Many of the means by which I have obtained motion on film, especially in my newer work, is a matter of extracting motion from designs that were not intended for that purpose, but just normally contained motion if one knew how to release it."

This quote inspired me to find the inherent motion in images and to release it. The low hanging fruit here relates to the rotoreliefs of Marcel Duchamp. The rotoreliefs are still images printed on discs that are spun on a turntable to release the inherent motion within them, as Belson would say. With computers, giving movement to images is simple and lends convenience to the process of rotating images at various speeds and in various ways. John Whitney's analog machines used before his entry into digital systmes are also relevant.

Stream stone surface is a colorful exploration of some movement paradoxes. It examines the stasis of flowing objects, the internal movements of objects in stasis, and the nature of these objects at their surface.
